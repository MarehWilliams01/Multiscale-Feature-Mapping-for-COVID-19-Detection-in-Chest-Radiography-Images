Deep Implicit Supervision with Multiscale Feature Mapping for COVID-19 Detection in Chest Radiography Images


COVID-19, which is short for Coronavirus Disease 2019, is a disease caused by a novel virus 
named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first 
confirmed in Wuhan in December 2019 and has caused significant global mortality within the 
years of 2019-2020. Given the absence of a definitive cure for the disease, early detection and 
isolation of infected individuals are crucial to prevent further outbreaks. This study proposes a 
deep learning-based model, referred to as the MIDSNet model (Multiscale Feature Extraction 
Mechanism and Implicit Deep Supervision), to accurately diagnose COVID-19 in its early 
stages using chest radiography images. By employing multiscale feature extraction and a 
implicit deep supervision mechanism, the MIDSNet model effectively captures visual patterns 
indicative of the disease. This research aims to provide a valuable tool for healthcare 
professionals to rapidly identify COVID-19 cases and other potential similar diseases in the 
future, to mitigate the impact of future pandemics.
